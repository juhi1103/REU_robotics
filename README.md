# Robotics Research Project 

There are various methods to maneuver a robot to push, grasp, pivot, or pull a certain object. 
The two main methods are prehensile and nonprehensile manipulation. 
Pushing objects with robots can be very useful if there is a certain position or target the object has to be pushed to and no matter what shape or size of an object

# Purpose 

- Assign target position to objects with random orientation	
- Push an object across the surface to a final target position 
- Collect data of different objects (cylinder & cube)
- Analyze the collected data to see if the proposed algorithm for pushing is accurate 

# Conclusion 
Cylinder Results:
Most of the cylinders had less than 0.27 cm distance from the target position 
The pushing of cylinders algorithm is highly accurate 
Cube Results: 
Majority of the cubes were between 0 cm and 0.43 cm from the target point 
The pushing for cubes algorithm is highly accurate
